Go is a versatile programming language used for a range of applications including complex backends, web applications, and cloud native applications.

You can run Go on your computer using the following two methods:

- Run Go online

- Install Go on your computer

In this tutorial, you will learn both methods.

## Run Go Online

To run Go code, you must have the Go compiler installed on your system. However, if you want to start immediately, you can use our free [online Go compiler](https://www.programiz.com/golang/online-compiler/).

The online editor enables you to run Go code directly in your browserâ€”no installation required.

## Install Go on Your Computer

For those who prefer to install C# on your computer, this guide will walk you through the installation process on Windows, macOS, or Linux (Ubuntu).

To install Go follow these steps:

1. Install VS Code

2. Download Go

3. Extract the downloaded file

4. Add to environment variable

5. Verify your Installation

Here is a detailed explanation of each of the steps:

#### Step 1: Install VS Code

Open the Terminal and type

```shell
sudo apt update
```

This command updates your package lists to ensure you get the latest versions of your software.

Proceed to install VS Code with

```shell
sudo snap install code --classic
```

#### Step 2: Download Go

Visit the [Go Download page](https://go.dev/doc/install) and click on the download button then choose the downloader for Linux.

```

![Extract the Go files](/images/programming-language/go/introduction/getting-started/go-getting-started-extract-download-file.png)

#### Step 4: Add to the Environment Variable

To use the `go` command in the terminal, we need to add the Go binary to the environment variable. We do so using the following command:

```shell
echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> $HOME/.profile
```

![Set Environment Variable for Go Ubuntu](/images/programming-language/go/introduction/getting-started/go-getting-started-set-go-env-variable-ubuntu.png)

After the command is executed, restart your computer to ensure that the Go binary is successfully added to the environment path variable.

#### Step 5: Verify Installation

To ensure that the Go has been installed correctly, verify the installation by checking Go version using the following command,

```shell
go version
```

## Run Your First Go Program

There are a few things you'll need to set up for running your first Go program.

- Install the Required Extensions in VS Code

- Create a Go file

- Write Your Go Program

- Run Your Program

### Install the required Extensions in VS Code

Before you begin coding, ensure that the **Code Runner** and **Go** extension is installed in VS Code.

Open VS Code and click on **Extensions** on the left sidebar. Search for **Code Runner** and click on **Install**. The Code Runner extension will allow you to run and execute Go code within VS Code.

![Code Runner Extension in VS Code](/images/programming-language/go/introduction/getting-started/go-getting-started-install-code-runner-extension-vs-code.png)

Similarly install the **Go** extension,

![Go Extension in VS Code](/images/programming-language/go/introduction/getting-started/go-getting-started-install-go-extension-vs-ubuntu.png)

This extension provides Go language support, debugging, and more, helping you develop Go applications efficiently.

### Create a Go File

In VS Code, Click on the **File** in the top menu and then select **New File**.

![Create a New File in VS Code](/images/programming-language/go/introduction/getting-started/go-getting-started-create-new-file-for-go.png)

Then, save this file with a .go extension by clicking on **File** again, then **Save As**, and type your filename ending in `.go`. (Here, we are saving it as `main.go`).

### Write Your Go Program

Now that you have created the file, it's time to start coding. Open the `main.go` file and write the following code:

```go title="main.go"
package main;
import "fmt"

func main(){
    fmt.Println("Hello World!");
}
```

### Run Your Program

Now it's time to run your first Go program. Click the run button at the top right of the VS Code Window.

![Run Your Program](/images/programming-language/go/introduction/getting-started/go-getting-started-run-your-go-program.png)

You should see `Hello World!` output to the console.

Now that you have set everything up to run the Go program on your computer, you'll be learning how the basic program works in Go in the next tutorial.
